# mantaray
A simple raytracer written in C++.

The project is not yet at a point where it can be built (even though there is a makefile). A large portion of the crucial code has been written, however I still need to design a scene to be rendered and link it all together. Also I need to find a way of creating an image from the photon simulations. SDL seems like the most reasonable approach.
